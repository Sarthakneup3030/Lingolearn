1. Database Collections:
For LingoLearn, we'll need the following collections:

    Users: Stores user information such as username, email, password, language preferences, progress, etc.
    Lessons: Stores lesson details like lesson name, content, difficulty level, language pair (source and target languages), etc.
    Vocabulary: Stores vocabulary words/phrases with translations and possibly example sentences.
    UserProgress: Tracks user progress for each lesson, including completion status, scores, etc.

2. Mockups/Wireframes:
I'll create mockups for the following activities:

    Login/Registration Activity
    Dashboard/Home Activity
    Lesson List Activity
    Lesson Detail/Practice Activity
    Vocabulary Activity
    Profile/Settings Activity

Each activity will follow Google's Material Design guidelines to ensure a consistent and intuitive user experience.

3. Application Shell:
I'll create a new Android Studio project with at least one activity, which will serve as the login/registration activity for LingoLearn.

4. GitHub Repository:
I'll set up a private GitHub repository for the project and add GitGrader as a collaborator. I'll push the initial application shell with the README.md file explaining the application and the technologies to be implemented.
