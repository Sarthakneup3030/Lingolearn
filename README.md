For this project, I will be making a language learning application which allows users to make 

account in the application. It will be multi-lingual meaning users can set the language to their 

native language or any language of their choice. The application will be able to track the 

progress of the user. There will be interactive exercises like quizzes which will provide feedback.

There will be offline mode for the users to download the lessons. There will be community 

where people can chat with other learners around the world so they can help each other to 

improve their language. So for this project I will be implementing the following features:

 Set up Firebase Project:

 Create a new Firebase project and configure Firebase Authentication and Cloud Firestore.

 Design User Interface:

 Create an intuitive and user-friendly interface for lessons, exercises, and progress 

tracking.

 Implement User Authentication:

 Integrate Firebase Authentication for user registration and login.

 Lesson Content Management:

 Develop functionality to retrieve and display lessons from Firebase Cloud Firestore.

 Progress Tracking System:

 Implement a system to track and display user progress using Firebase.

 Interactive Exercises:

 Create interactive exercises and store user responses in Firebase.

 Quizzes and Challenges:

 Develop quiz features and store quiz data in Firebase.
